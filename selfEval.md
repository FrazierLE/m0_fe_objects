# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
At first, I was confused where to write Object.keys and Objects.values, but once I figured it out, this lesson was a breeze.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I feel like it's been going well. I was always a note taker in school. I tend to lean more towards writing everything down over nothing.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I start with trial and error, and if I'm really hitting a road block, I'll google things or watch youtube videos.
